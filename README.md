# Resume API

## What's new:

### Two features/improvements included in JWT Auth (restframework_simplejwt)

1. Fix: Disable refresh token for inactive user(https://github.com/jazzband/djangorestframework-simplejwt/pull/814/commits/76741ff9ae347c8e7d52101c4bc11985f3940992)

2. Add the refresh token to the outstanding db after refreshing(https://github.com/jazzband/djangorestframework-simplejwt/pull/696)


## Overview

The Resume API provides a platform for users to create and manage their resumes. It supports account creation, issues JWT tokens needed for resume management, and enforces a throttling limit of 200 requests per day for all user types. Users can create, update, and delete their resumes through this API.

**Note:** 
To enhance security, JWTs are now actively managed:

Token Blacklisting: JWTs can be blacklisted, preventing their further use.

Scheduled Token Deletion: Blacklisted tokens are automatically deleted after 1 day. This process is managed by a scheduled task that runs daily at 00:00 UTC, utilizing Celery Beat for scheduling and Celery Worker for task execution. Redis serves as the message broker, and the database backend stores task results.
